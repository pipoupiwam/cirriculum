Django websockets
=======================


Not yet available, to be done.

Using websockets
I had to design and develop a django application to manage autonomous vehicles.
The vehicles report telemetry and position

The django app is responsible for database and displaying vehicles on a web interface

- read real time data
- store data in database
- display data in real time
- use redis as data broker

Google slide Schema with data flows
