Experiences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Since graduation, I had the opportunity to work in several companies as a Python / Django developer

[2022 - 2023] Padam AV : Python developer
------------------------------------------
Padam AV (Autonomous Vehicles) is a spinup of Padam Mobility, its focuses on integrating Autonomous vehicles into a DRT
system, where padam AV would be a virtual driver giving orders to autonomous vehicles ( e.g: go to this location and open doors )
and monitor its progress.

As the single developer, my role was to design the project from scratch, setup a scalable architecture, develop the MVP
and recruit a small team of developers to pursue the development.


**Technologies** : **Python**, **Django**, **Websockets**, **Pytest**, **AWS**, Terraform, Asynchronous tasks, Real time data ingestion.

[2019 - 2022] Padam Mobility : Tech team lead
----------------------------------------------------------------
Padam Mobility provides a DRT ( Demand Responsive Transport ) software suite to transport operators.

As a Tech Team Lead, I was in charge of the "Operators" team composed of 8 developers. We focused on the development of the  backoffice of
the DRT software.

Projects :

- Development of internal tools to ease the setup and reduce the marginal cost of new clients.
  ( Task automation, quality gates, process design )
- Development of a DRT simulator to launch territory wide simulations on how the DRT system would work in
- Full refactoring of the geography database of the project. The goal was to re-develop the code in order to stabilize
  it, make it predictable, enhance performances and add new features such as travel time customization.
- Stabilization and re-design of the test suit and CI-CD pipeline.
- Deployment and maintenance of the ELK suit ( ElasticSearch, Logstash, Kibana ) as a centralized logging platform,
  previously each client had its own logging system. We managed to significantly reduce maintenance time and running costs.
- Migration from Python2 to Python3.
