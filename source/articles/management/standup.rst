When to standup ?
===================

Issues I encountered while organizing standup meetings :
- too early in the morning, some people may be late, or it may be difficult for people working from different tinezones
- after the lunch break : people are not productive, they come back from the break, not finished discussion are still in mind,
and digestion has its effects
- in the afternoon : This is generally the productive part of the day, the less interuptions there are the best it is for prodctivity

Start 15 minutes before the lunch break
